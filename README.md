Artifical Neural Networks for Predictive handwroten digit model
Artifical some spiking and other neural network abilities with I used for this project.

THERE IS NO ERROR FUNCTION AND NO OPTIMIZATION ALGORITHM. I USE DIFFERENT TRAINING TECHNIC.

It uses my original optimization algorithm inside.

For more information about this project here my YouTube video (turkish) : https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=foNT6CEFsvE&t=10s&ab_channel=HasanCanBeydili

If you want a train or test this model I builded everything. But it is still trainied weights inside

For more test data, here a photo drawing website here: https://pixlr.com/tr/editor/

  Use this website for new test data, don't forget your photo must be 28*28 pixel.


You must a install Octave: https://octave.org/download
